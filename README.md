# Deep-fake-detection

The widespread usage of face swapping deepfake models, which creates a
considerable number of phoney videos and images that seem incredibly real, is
presently putting the privacy of people and whole nations in danger. Fake news is
sweeping the internet like wildfire because DeepFake production tools have devel-
oped so quickly and because so many researchers and companies are interested in
exploring their limits. This research suggests EfficientNet CNNs with an LSTM
classifier as a DeepFake detection and classification model. After the model has
recovered the face part from video frames, the CNN enhanced with LSTM &
ReLU is utilised to extract features from these faces and classify. For the Deep-
fake video detection, a CNN equipped with LSTM model was applied to ensure
model validity while keeping an appropriate weight.
Therefore, in order to effectively detect deep fakes, requires stronger deep fake
detection algorithms. The system that has been proposed is built on a combination
of CNN and RNN. The system that is being presented makes use of the CNN model
to extract feature vectors from the movies, and then it uses those feature vectors
to train an RNN model to classify the videos as Real or deep-fake.
The proposed modelâ€™s effectiveness was evaluated on the Face Forensics and
Celeb-DF deep fake datasets. Experimental results demonstrated that the sug-
gested model had an average prediction rate of 84.61% for deep-fake films and
90.22% for Face Forensics movies under real network diffusion settings. In com-
parison to convolutional neural network-based systems like ShuffleNet, DenseNet,
and MobileNet, the suggested model produced the best results with an accuracy
rate of 88.46%.
